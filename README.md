# microbit-acc
 To get the values I flashed the microbit-code.py on the microbit, which records acceleration values when you press button A, and stops when button B is pressed. To get the values off the microbit I have used [UFS](http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/storage.html#file-transfer) on my linux machine. Don't forget that to flash the code on the microbit you will need to install micropython, otherwise the microbit won't have access to some libraries. FIle acc-analysis.py analises the data and give a plot of the values, one plot for unadjusted raw values, and the other one for change in acceleration in xyz planes.
